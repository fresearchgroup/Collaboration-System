The model would be trained on an existing database in the backend which would probably give a confidence score on how appropriate the content is. Two cases might arise: one, where the model predicts the article to be inappropriate, but the user insists it to be appropriate, the user will submit it for a review by a moderator; and second, where the model predicted the article was appropriate, but it wasn’t. In the second case, there would be a button to report such articles. If a sufficient number of users reported the article, then it will be reviewed by a moderator. In case, the moderator decides the article to be indeed inappropriate, the article will be removed, and the model will be tuned accordingly.</p><h3><strong>Recommendation System</strong></h3><p>The recommendation system will suggest users new articles depending on which articles he/she has liked or viewed previously. Communities will be suggested in a similar way. The suggestions could appear on his dashboard, or maybe on the homepage.

The main group of Indo-Aryan languages stretches across north and central India. The literary development of these languages took place at various times.An important new feature in the modern languages, as opposed to the earlier Middle Indo-Aryan, was the extensive introduction of Sanskrit loanwords. After the eighteenth century, under the impact of British rule and European contact as well as the introduction of printing, the range of subjects for literature widened and was modernized. Literary output increased. The processes initiated at that time have continued till the present day.The Dravidian languages are Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam, of which Tamil was the earliest to be developed for literary purposes.','historical','2018-01-29 14:55:53.765413','Ancient Languages','community/4f7084f2-3523-48e9-a3af-e85806c38cb8.jpg','ancient-languages-4',3),(4,'Archaeological Survey of India ','The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), under the Ministry of Culture, is the premier organization for the archaeological researches and protection of the cultural heritage of the nation.

The main group of Indo-Aryan languages stretches across north and central India. The literary development of these languages took place at various times.An important new feature in the modern languages, as opposed to the earlier Middle Indo-Aryan, was the extensive introduction of Sanskrit loanwords. After the eighteenth century, under the impact of British rule and European contact as well as the introduction of printing, the range of subjects for literature widened and was modernized.
